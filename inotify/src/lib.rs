///
/// `Inotify` is a wrapper around an inotify instance. It generally tries to
/// adhere to the underlying inotify API as closely as possible, while at the
/// same time making access to it safe and convenient.
///
/// Please note that using inotify correctly is not always trivial, and while
/// this wrapper tries to alleviate that, it is not perfect. Please refer to the
/// inotify man pages for potential problems to watch out for.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
/// use inotify::{
///     Inotify,
///     watch_mask,
/// };
///
/// let mut inotify = Inotify::init()
///     .expect("Error while initializing inotify instance");
///
/// # // Create a temporary file, so `add_watch` won't return an error.
/// # use std::fs::File;
/// # let mut test_file = File::create("/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file")
/// #     .expect("Failed to create test file");
/// #
/// // Watch for modify and close events.
/// inotify
///     .add_watch(
///         "/tmp/inotify-rs-test-file",
///         watch_mask::MODIFY | watch_mask::CLOSE,
///     )
///     .expect("Failed to add file watch");
///
/// # // Modify file, so the following `read_events_blocking` won't block.
/// # use std::io::Write;
/// # write!(&mut test_file, "something\n")
/// #     .expect("Failed to write something to test file");
